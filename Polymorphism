Polymorphism:

      Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
      In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
      The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.
      
Example 

Lets consider a person who is working in the company so he is an employee,the same person who is son of his parent 
the same person have different roles in his life which is called polymorphism.

Advantages of Polymorphism:
     1.Programmers code can be reused via Polymorphism.
     2.Supports a single variable name for multiple data types.
     3.Reduces coupling between different functionalities.

Disadvantages of Polymorphism:
     1.Polymorphism ends up raising performance issues in real-time.
     2.Polymorphism reduces the readability of the code.
     3.Programmers find Polymorphism a little challenging to implement.
