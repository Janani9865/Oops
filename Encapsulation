what is Encapsulation :

     Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class

Types of Encapsulation in OOPs:

1. Data Member Encapsulation
2. Method Encapsulation
3. Class Encapsulation

Real-Life Example of Encapsulation:
     
     Let's look at a real-life example to better comprehend the notion of encapsulation.
     Consider a Capsule as an example (Medicine).
     
Advantages of Encapsulation:

Data Protection:
The program runner will not be able to identify or see which methods are present in the code. 

Flexibility: 
The code which is encapsulated looks more cleaner and flexible, and can be changed as per the needs. 

Reusability:
The methods can be changed and the code is reusable.

Disadvantages of Encapsulation:

Code Size:
The length of the code increases drastically in the case of encapsulation as we need to provide all the methods with the specifiers.

More Instructions:
As the size of the code increases, therefore, you need to provide additional instructions for every method.

Increased code execution:
Encapsulation results in an increase in the duration of the program execution. It is because more instructions are added to the code therefore they require more time to execute.
