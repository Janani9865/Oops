STACK:
      A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner.
      In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. 
      The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop.
      push(a) – It is used to inserts the element – Time Complexity: O(1)
      pop() – It is used to deletes the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
      
      Example:
           Browser History, Deck of cards, stack of plates. 
           
           
 QUEUE:
      Queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In First Out (FIFO) manner.
      With a queue, the least recently added item is removed first.
      A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
      
      Example:
           Call Center Systems
